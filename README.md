## About the Game "Snake"

Snake is a 2D casual game in which you use the keyboard buttons (**UP**, **DOWN**, **LEFT** and **RIGHT**) to guide a snake to eat more food, and grow longer. Be careful not to bite itself when it grows long enough!

The game is built with C++ and an open source development library called SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer).

The **Snake-Win32.zip** is a standalone playable edition of the game.
